## Project Details
This single-page web application was designed by Aaron David, Paige Tetzlaff and Julia Jones for their Phase 2 group project at Flatiron School during the 10-10-22 East Cohort.

The focus of this project was to use build a React single page application from scratch. Our project includes search functionality, utilizing a client-side routing technique via React Router and a controlled-form with the ability to complete a POST fetch request to our custom RESTful API running on a JSON-server. 

The content of our application is based around the aquatic activity of scuba diving. We created a library of diving sites that included information about specific locations and countries that offer popular diving experiences. The premise of our site was to provide enthusiast a way to learn more about divng locations and to request more information about other possible spots. 

The webpage was built from the ground up using React, JavaScript and CSS.
