      "location_description": "Situated nearly 350 km away from Cairns, Osprey Reef is the most northerly of the reefs in the Coral Sea. It is separated from the continental shelf by a deep water trough and is regarded as one of the premier Great Barrier Reef dive liveaboard destinations, both for the visibility that it offers and the big fish action. The remoteness of Osprey Reef is a highlight in itself, where you will often find yourself far removed from anything that isn't wet and colourful.",
      "dive_summary": "Roughly oval in shape, Osprey Reef consists of a lagoon area, that is only 30m deep, but within 1 km of the reef the water shelves to 1,000m deep. This creates the perfect meeting ground for huge amounts of pelagic action including Australia's famous shark feed dive at North Horn. The reef is in pristine condition with spectacular colourful soft corals that often exceed 2m in height. Shoals of pelagic fish and amazing walls will leave you wanting more no-stop time.",

Had he not turned north-east to avoid the perilous breakers over this reef, he may have 'discovered' Australia 2 years before Captain Cook. Imagine how different Australia could have been if colonised by the French! The reef which bears his name lies some 150 km to the south of Osprey Reef and is not often visited by Australian liveaboards in this area. Normally, Coral Sea trips will return to the Ribbon Reefs after visiting Osprey Reef but if conditions permit, you may be lucky enough to dive around this exposed offshore reef.",
      "dive_summary": "Dives here typically consist of quite steep walls from about 15 to 40 metres followed by a slope to greater depths. There are the same type of healthy hard corals you might see at Osprey Reef and also plenty of schools of fish. Bumphead parrotfish in schools of up to 50 regularly charge around munching the coral into a fine sand. Yellow-tailed barracuda and jacks are also present in impressive numbers.",

      "location_description": "The best known of the Revillagigedos of Mexico is Socorro Island, so much so that the group of islands is often referred to collectively as 'Socorro'. Approximately 9 miles (15 km) wide, the island and its surrounding waters have become synonymous with liveaboard diving cruises and big fish action, particularly manta rays, sharks (hammerheads, silkies, oceanic whitetips, silvertips, Galapagos sharks, tiger sharks and whale sharks), dolphins and even whales.",
      "dive_summary": "Imagine visiting these distant shores and then submerging yourself in a watery environment where the songs of gentle giants can be heard throughout your dive.",
      "depth": "33ft - 100ft",
      "visibility": "15m - 35m",
      "currents": "Moderate but can be strong",
      "surface_conditions": "Can be choppy.",
      "water_temp": "21°C - 26°C",
      "experience_level": "Intermediate - Advanced",
      "number_of_dives_sites": 12,
      "diving_season": "November through June reflects the Socorro liveaboard safari season. The winter months of late January through early April are the best times to see humpback whales. This is when water temperatures are at their lowest at 70 to 73°F (21-23°C). Outside of this time it is likely to be warmer at 73 to 79°F (23-26°C) and a better time for manta rays and sharks. This is roughly the November through early January period and most of April and May. ",
