      "location_description": "Situated nearly 350 km away from Cairns, Osprey Reef is the most northerly of the reefs in the Coral Sea. It is separated from the continental shelf by a deep water trough and is regarded as one of the premier Great Barrier Reef dive liveaboard destinations, both for the visibility that it offers and the big fish action. The remoteness of Osprey Reef is a highlight in itself, where you will often find yourself far removed from anything that isn't wet and colourful.",
      "dive_summary": "Roughly oval in shape, Osprey Reef consists of a lagoon area, that is only 30m deep, but within 1 km of the reef the water shelves to 1,000m deep. This creates the perfect meeting ground for huge amounts of pelagic action including Australia's famous shark feed dive at North Horn. The reef is in pristine condition with spectacular colourful soft corals that often exceed 2m in height. Shoals of pelagic fish and amazing walls will leave you wanting more no-stop time.",

Had he not turned north-east to avoid the perilous breakers over this reef, he may have 'discovered' Australia 2 years before Captain Cook. Imagine how different Australia could have been if colonised by the French! The reef which bears his name lies some 150 km to the south of Osprey Reef and is not often visited by Australian liveaboards in this area. Normally, Coral Sea trips will return to the Ribbon Reefs after visiting Osprey Reef but if conditions permit, you may be lucky enough to dive around this exposed offshore reef.",
      "dive_summary": "Dives here typically consist of quite steep walls from about 15 to 40 metres followed by a slope to greater depths. There are the same type of healthy hard corals you might see at Osprey Reef and also plenty of schools of fish. Bumphead parrotfish in schools of up to 50 regularly charge around munching the coral into a fine sand. Yellow-tailed barracuda and jacks are also present in impressive numbers.",

Due to the myriad channels and passages between the atolls, the currents sweep and play throughout the island chain so that nutrients are always on the move.
